# TCA
Identifying age-specific gene signatures of the human cerebral cortex with joint analysis of transcriptomes and functional connectomes
Here we present a method, TCA (Transcriptome- Connectome correlation Analysis), to identify gene signatures associated with cortex development and functionality across lifespan
## List of files

- Below the statistic folder are the intermediate statistical results generated, including enrichment analysis, regulatory networks, differentially expressed genes, etc.
- the R script of getStablegene.R is the method to get the stable gene that are stable expressed in each age group.
- the R script of networkBuild.R  is the TCA algorithm  to process the gene expression file, and get the ASC gene(Target Gene)
- Below the diseaseRiskPos folder is the  risk positions of different psychiatric disorders
